Principles of Programming Languages (Fall 2018)

This repo contains some project files from my PL course.

This course basically explored language design using Java and Haskell. We learnt about what works and what doesn't work 
for languages and used Java as a case-study almost to look at: object orientation, parametric polymorphism, and functional programming.
At some point, we wrote a Java intepreter using Haskell.
